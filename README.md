# Next.js Compare Weather Tool

This project was created as a separate project from the last task from : [link](https://github.com/CarolinaFledgling/next.js-rest-api-tasks) project.

The goal of this project is to practice Typescript through a real project.

The project allows users to monitor and compare weather from multiple countries and their capitals. Displaying them in Table format with ability for editing entered countries and deleting them from the table.

I fetch data from two separate api services to achieve that and practice working with REST API.
