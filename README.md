# Next.js Compare Weather Tool

 My small personal project which allows me to monitor and compare weather from multiple countries and their capitals. 
 I fetch data from two separate api services to achieve that. and I present data in the table.
 Added ability for editing entered countries and deleting them from the table.  


# The goal of the project
